abstract = {Long-range sequencing information is required for haplotype phasing, de novo assembly and structural variation detection. Current long-read sequencing technologies can provide valuable long-range information but at a high cost with low accuracy and high DNA input requirement. We have developed a single-tube Transposase Enzyme Linked Long-read Sequencing (TELL-Seq™) technology, which enables a low-cost, high-accuracy and high-throughput short-read next generation sequencer to routinely generate over 100 Kb long-range sequencing information with as little as 0.1 ng input material. In a PCR tube, millions of clonally barcoded beads are used to uniquely barcode long DNA molecules in an open bulk reaction without dilution and compartmentation. The barcode linked reads are used to successfully assemble genomes ranging from microbes to human. These linked-reads also generate mega-base-long phased blocks and provide a cost-effective tool for detecting structural variants in a genome, which are important to identify compound heterozygosity in recessive Mendelian diseases and discover genetic drivers and diagnostic biomarkers in cancers.},

@article{Zhang2017,
abstract = {Haplotype-resolved genome sequencing promises to unlock a wealth of information in population and medical genetics. However, for the vast majority of genomes sequenced to date, haplotypes have not been determined because of cumbersome haplotyping workflows that require fractions of the genome to be sequenced in a large number of compartments. Here we demonstrate barcode partitioning of long DNA molecules in a single compartment using "on-bead" barcoded tagmentation. The key to the method that we call "contiguity preserving transposition" sequencing on beads (CPTv2-seq) is transposon-mediated transfer of homogenous populations of barcodes from beads to individual long DNA molecules that get fragmented at the same time (tagmentation). These are then processed to sequencing libraries wherein all sequencing reads originating from each long DNA molecule share a common barcode. Single-tube, bulk processing of long DNA molecules with ∼150,000 different barcoded bead types provides a barcode-linked read structure that reveals long-range molecular contiguity. This technology provides a simple, rapid, plate-scalable and automatable route to accurate, haplotype-resolved sequencing, and phasing of structural variants of the genome.},

@article{Wang2019,
abstract = {Here, we describe single-tube long fragment read (stLFR), a technology that enables sequencing of data from long DNA molecules using economical second-generation sequencing technology. It is based on adding the same barcode sequence to subfragments of the original long DNA molecule (DNA cobarcoding). To achieve this efficiently, stLFR uses the surface of microbeads to create millions of miniaturized barcoding reactions in a single tube. Using a combinatorial process, up to 3.6 billion unique barcode sequences were generated on beads, enabling practically nonredundant cobarcoding with 50 million barcodes per sample. Using stLFR, we demonstrate efficient unique cobarcoding of more than 8 million 20- to 300-kb genomic DNA fragments. Analysis of the human genome NA12878 with stLFR demonstrated high-quality variant calling and phase block lengths up to N50 34 Mb. We also demonstrate detection of complex structural variants and complete diploid de novo assembly of NA12878. These analyses were all performed using single stLFR libraries, and their construction did not significantly add to the time or cost of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) library preparation. stLFR represents an easily automatable solution that enables high-quality sequencing, phasing, SV detection, scaffolding, cost-effective diploid de novo genome assembly, and other long DNA sequencing applications.},

Assembly quality may be degraded due to unfiltered chimeric reads; also, the storage of all read overlaps can take up to terabytes of disk space.We introduce two tools, yacrd and fpa, preform respectively chimera removal, read scrubbing, and filter out spurious overlaps. We show that yacrd results in higher-quality assemblies and is one hundred times faster than the best available alternative.https://github.com/natir/yacrd and https://github.com/natir/fpaSupplementary data are available online.}",
